# Spring Boot Koans

The goal of this project is to learn how Spring Boot can be configured and tested.

## Getting Started

There is a run configuration (Execute All Tests) in the project which just executes all tests. Initially all tests will fail. Your task is to finish all the lessons and execute all the tests successfully. 

### Prerequisites

This project is configured to run on IntelliJ IDEA. Eclipse should not be a problem, but there are some limitations such as not executable run configurations.

### Installing

* Open IntelliJ IDEA and go to **File** -> **Open**
* Search for the build.gradle file and click **OK**
* Click on **Open as Project**
